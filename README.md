# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Explainable AI (XAI)

This repository contains a Colab notebook implementation for predicting **crop yield** using machine learning and **Explainable AI techniques (XAI)**.  
The goal is to accurately forecast yield and interpret the key factors influencing model decisions.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- Build regression models to **predict crop yield** based on climate, soil, and crop parameters  
- Compare multiple ML/DL architectures for performance (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, etc.)  
- Apply **Explainable AI methods (SHAP / LIME)** to interpret model predictions  
- Visualize feature importance and contribution to yield prediction  
- Explore model transparency to support **data-driven agricultural decisions**

## 🧩 Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** — handle missing values, normalize data  
2. **Feature Engineering** — extract key environmental and soil attributes  
3. **Model Training** — evaluate multiple ML/DL models  
4. **Explainability** — interpret predictions with SHAP/LIME  
5. **Visualization** — plot yield trends, feature importance, and explanations
